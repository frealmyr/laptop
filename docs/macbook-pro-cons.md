## Pro

  - The hardware is unrivaled.

## Con

  - XDR Mini-LED display forces local dimming, which makes photo/video editing a pain. Betterdisplay added a experimental flag for disabling, however this makes the OS crash and is not usable.
  - XDR display have a lot of ghosting in 120Hz VRR mode.
  - Sleep drains the battery ~10% overnight. Due to Airdrop, continuity, screen time, FindMyMac++
    - Avoiding drain requires turning off WiFi/Bluetooth on sleep.
  - Non-Retina external displays (as in not Apple) looks absolutely ass. Need 3rd party app for forcing fractional scaling, HiDPI and subpixel sampling.
  - If you are sensitive to PWM backlight flickering, then MacOS has GPU Dithering enabled by default.
